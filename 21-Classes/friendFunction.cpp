C++ Friend Functions
Normally, private members of a class can only be accessed using public methods like getters and setters. But in some cases, you can use a special function called a friend function to access them directly.

A friend function is not a member of the class, but it is allowed to access the class's private data:
*/

class Employee {
  private:
    int salary;  // Private attribute

  public:
    Employee(int s) {  // Constructor
      salary = s;      // Initialize salary
    }

    // Declare friend function
    friend void displaySalary(Employee emp);
};

void displaySalary(Employee emp) {  // Friend function definition
  cout << "Salary: " << emp.salary;
}

int main() {
  Employee myEmp(50000);
  displaySalary(myEmp);
  return 0;
}

/*
Example Explained
The friend function displaySalary() is declared inside the Employee class but defined outside of it.
Even though displaySalary() is not a member of the class, it can still access the private member salary.
In the main() function, we create an Employee object and call the friend function to print its salary.
